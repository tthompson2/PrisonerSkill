                <p>My name is Ray Aguilar. I was born and raised in the Midwest. I'm a heavy equipment operator at a
                    rock quarry who isn't satifised with the pay or the work itself. I love technology and I love
                    challenges, that's when I stumbled upon coding. I'm a 23 year old Full Stack Web Developer who is
                    currently a student at Lambda School who continues to learn coding everyday.

                <p>I have been coding since I was 14 years old I started with Arduino learning C and making the little
                    blinking lights and spinning motors but once I was done with that I moved on to make a bluetooth
                    controlled car with DC motors and a lot of hard hours of coding. I expanded my skills from there to
                    HTML, CSS and JavaScript for web developement.

                <h3>Aaron Troska</h3>

                <p>My passion for coding started in college where I would watch my roommate dissect his code like a
                    virtual biologist and put it all back together. It wasn't until after graduation that I realized the
                    seed planted by my roommate was beginning to sprout. So I started to teach myself and eventually
                    found Lambda, which has been the fertilizer to help this passion grow from the seedling planted by
                    my roommate, to the blossoming tree that it is today.
