            <h2 class="body">Benefits of Hiring Prisoners</h2>
            <p class="body">
                The benefits of hiring prisoners for work release are abundant on all sides. Obvious bonus for the prisoners 
                as they get to join society again and work not only towards money but making sure that they don't end up back 
                in prison. The wardens get to see their own inmates grow up and make a work ethic for themselves, and finally 
                the employers get well vetted workers on their team for a good price.

                    <h3>Pricing</h3>
                    <p>
                        The pricing for hiring inmates at your place of employment is substantially less in all industries 
                        and you get to be part of the best rehabilitation act that you can provide.

                    <h3>Benefits</h3>
                    <p>
                        A benefits package of any sort is not required to hire inmates they get all of their healthcare needs 
                        provided to them by the state and that means less money out of your pocket and more that you can invest 
                        back into the company.

                    <h3>Employees</h3>
                    <p>
                        Inmates will be held to just as high of a standard as any other employee and always have a reliable form 
                        of transportation provided by the state so you won't have to worry about them ever being late.
